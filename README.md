This project implements a stack using linked list and a circular buffer using an array in C. A stack, a LIFO object is used for memory management and expression evaluations (parantheses matching). A queue, a FIFO object is used when a part of a code (possibly an interrupt) is producing data (enqueues) and another part of code consumes data (dequeues). The latter find its use while reading data byte by byte from a UART.
